#TODO
This is a list of initial features that are not implimented yet.  Feel free to fix these and submit a pull request to fix any of these.

* Login - Need to add a login feature to protect from unauthorized access to the service.
* Remote Playback - The remote should have an option to switch playback from the player.html to the local remote.  Make sure the playback resumes from the same place the video was stopped at.
* Library Management - This probably need to have the login implemented first.  Media should be able to be uploaded from a page, as well as retreaving from the local filesystem.  Once uploaded, convert to the users selected format. (default: webm)
* Show Album Art - When playing music, show the album art, if avaliable;
* Pictures - Need to add picture media option.  Not hard, I just haven't finished it.
* Bug Fixes - I'm certain there are things that aren't working quite right.  Need to fill out GitHub issues for these.
